    "# Generative Adversarial Network\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be building a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. From this, we'll be able to generate new handwritten digits!\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs were [first reported on](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) in 2014 from Ian Goodfellow and others in Yoshua Bengio's lab. Since then, GANs have exploded in popularity. Here are a few examples to check out:\n",

    "* [A whole list](https://github.com/wiseodd/generative-models)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind GANs is that you have two networks, a generator $G$ and a discriminator $D$, competing against each other. The generator makes fake data to pass to the discriminator. The discriminator also sees real data and predicts if the data it's received is real or fake. The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, it wants to output data that looks _as close as possible_ to real data. And the discriminator is trained to figure out which data is real and which is fake. What ends up happening is that the generator learns to make data that is indistiguishable from real data to the discriminator.\n",

    "![GAN diagram](assets/gan_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure of a GAN is shown in the diagram above, using MNIST images as data. The latent sample is a random vector the generator uses to contruct it's fake images. As the generator learns through training, it figures out how to map these random vectors to recognizable images that can foold the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the discriminator is a sigmoid function, where 0 indicates a fake image and 1 indicates an real image. If you're interested only in generating new images, you can throw out the discriminator after training. Now, let's see how we build this thing in TensorFlow."

We should use a leaky ReLU to allow gradients to flow backwards through the layer unimpeded. A leaky ReLU is like a normal ReLU, except that there is a small non-zero output for negative input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Scope\n",
    "Here we need to use `tf.variable_scope` for two reasons. Firstly, we're going to make sure all the variable names start with `generator`. Similarly, we'll prepend `discriminator` to the discriminator variables. This will help out later when we're training the separate networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could just use `tf.name_scope` to set the names, but we also want to reuse these networks with different inputs. For the generator, we're going to train it, but also _sample from it_ as we're training and after training. The discriminator will need to share variables between the fake and real input images. So, we can use the `reuse` keyword for `tf.variable_scope` to tell TensorFlow to reuse the variables instead of creating new ones if we build the graph again.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `tf.variable_scope`, you use a `with` statement:\n",

    "TensorFlow doesn't provide an operation for leaky ReLUs, so we'll need to make one . For this you can use take the outputs from a linear fully connected layer and pass them to `tf.maximum`. Typically, a parameter `alpha` sets the magnitude of the output for negative values. So, the output for negative input (`x`) values is `alpha*x`, and the output for positive `x` is `x`:\n",
