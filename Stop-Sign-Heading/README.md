# lvl5 Stop Sign Heading Problem

## Challenge

Predict the heading (in degrees) of the stop sign (relative to the camera).

## Dataset

We've provided a total of 4830 images for training, testing and validation.  The image set spans the range of [-80,80] degrees of heading at increments of 1 degree, with 30 images sampled at each heading..  A sign has a relative heading of 0 degrees, when it is directly facing the camera.

Images are located in `images/sign_<HEADING_DEGREES>_XX.jpg`
